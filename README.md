# Yet Another Firmware Selector

A simple OpenWrt firmware selector using autocompletion. Uses plain HTML/JavaScript.

Run:

* Download repository and change directory to it
* Start webserver (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`)
* Go to `http://localhost:8000`

Configure with [config.js](config.js).

## Update Database

OpenWrt master has a feature to create json files: `Global build settings  ---> [*] Create JSON info files per build image`.

A [Python script](misc/collect.py) is included that can merge all these JSON files for a new data.json file: `./collect.py bin/ > data.json`

The data JSON file can also include a link that will overwrite downloadLink from `config.json`.

## Contributions

It would be nice to have more features. E.g.:

* more translations
* help text for images
* better CSS
